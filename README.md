## Features

- **Real-Time Transcription**: Transcribes speech from the microphone instantaneously.
- **Noise Filtering**: Smartly differentiates between human speech and background noise.
- **User Interface**: Simple and intuitive GUI to start/stop transcription effortlessly.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account.
- Speech-to-Text API enabled within your GCP account.
- A GCP service account key file downloaded and securely saved.

## Setup and Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[Your GitHub Username]/real-time-transcription.git
cd real-time-transcription
```

### Environment Setup

It's recommended to use a virtual environment for running this project:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
.\myenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # On Windows
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Unix or MacOS
```

### Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install google-cloud-speech pyaudio
```

### Configure GCP Credentials

Ensure the application can authenticate with Google Cloud:

```python
os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS'] = 'path_to_your_service_account_key.json'
```

## Running the Application

With everything set up, you can run the application using:

```bash
python transcribe.py
```

## How to Use

- **Start Transcription**: Click the "Start Transcription" button to initiate real-time transcription.
- **Stop Transcription**: Click "Stop Transcription" to pause the process. The application displays transcribed text as it processes audio input.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, particularly with installing `pyaudio`, consider using `pipwin`:

```bash
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
```
